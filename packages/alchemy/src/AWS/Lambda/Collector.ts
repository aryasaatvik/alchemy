/**
 * The OpenTelemetry Collector as a Lambda extension, wired in one call.
 *
 * Effect's telemetry exports over OTLP/HTTP to a Collector running *inside*
 * the execution environment, and the Collector owns the remote export:
 *
 * ```text
 * Effect telemetry -> OTLP/HTTP on localhost -> Collector extension -> backend
 * ```
 *
 * The handler's invocation-scoped exporter flushes to loopback, which is
 * fast and local. The Collector's `decouple` processor then ships to the
 * remote backend on the extension's own lifecycle, so backend latency does
 * not sit in front of the response. Delivery is best-effort, not durable —
 * a frozen or reclaimed environment can drop what is still queued, and a
 * slow backend can still consume billed duration or delay environment
 * reuse. Business-critical events belong in durable storage written by the
 * handler.

 *                   // An Output: bound as an env var, never baked into the
 *                   // layer, so repointing the backend does not republish it.
 *                   endpoint: backend.url,
 *                   // A Redacted: bound through the secret channel. A layer
 *                   // is a downloadable artifact — a token baked in is a

 *           },
 *         }),
 *       }),
 *     ),
 *   ),
 * ) {}
 * ```
 *
 * @example A literal prefix in front of a secret
 * ```typescript
 * // `Bearer ` is not part of the token, and applying it must not drag the
 * // token into the layer archive to do it. `interpolate` concatenates and
 * // nothing else: the literal bakes, the `Redacted` still binds.

 *   endpoint: "https://api.example.com",
 *   headers: {
 *     authorization: AWS.Lambda.interpolate`Bearer ${token.value}`,
 *   },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example A variable the deployed environment already provides
 * ```typescript
 * // A `Config` primitive NAMES a variable rather than carrying a value: it
 * // renders as that exact name and binds nothing, so the emitted file — and
 * // therefore the config layer — is identical whatever the variable holds.
 * // Reach for it when something other than this deploy provisions the value.
 * AWS.Lambda.Exporter.otlpHttp("backend", {
 *   endpoint: Config.string("BACKEND_URL"),
 *   headers: {
 *     authorization: AWS.Lambda.interpolate`Bearer ${Config.redacted("INGEST_TOKEN")}`,
 *   },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @section Sharing one configuration layer
 * @example One layer, several Functions
 * ```typescript
 * // Each Function gets its own config layer by default. Name the same
 * // `configId` from two Functions to share one — their configurations must
 * // be identical, and a mismatch fails the build.
 * const collectorConfig = AWS.Lambda.collector({
 *   pipelines: { traces: tracesPipeline },
 * });
 *
 * AWS.Lambda.Collector({ config: collectorConfig, configId: "SharedCollectorConfig" });
 * ```
 *
 * @section Pinning and overrides
 * @example Move to another upstream release
 * ```typescript
 * AWS.Lambda.Collector({
 *   config: collectorConfig,
 *   extension: { release: "0_23_0", layerVersion: 1 },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example A mirrored or private extension layer
 * ```typescript
 * AWS.Lambda.Collector({
 *   config: collectorConfig,
 *   extension: { layerVersionArn: mirroredLayer.layerVersionArn },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Deploy the layer in a fixed region
 * ```typescript
 * // Layer ARNs are region-scoped; override when the deploy region and the
 * // Function's region are derived separately.
 * AWS.Lambda.Collector({
 *   config: collectorConfig,
 *   extension: { region: "us-east-1", architecture: "arm64" },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @section Dev mode
 * @example Opt a dev run back into real export
 * ```typescript
 * // The extension is a published layer on a real Lambda, so it is disabled
 * // during `alchemy dev` by default.
 * AWS.Lambda.Collector({ config: collectorConfig, disabled: false })
 * ```
 *
 * @section Sharing the layer between Functions
 * The returned layer is `Layer.fresh`: attaching is a build-time side effect
 * against the ambient `Binding.Host`, so one value provided to several
 * Functions must build once per host. Without `fresh`, layer memoization
 * hands every host after the first the original build — a Function that
 * silently deploys with no telemetry at all. The configuration LayerVersion
 * is unaffected: resources memoize by logical id, so two Functions naming
 * the same `configId` still register exactly one resource. Freshness does not
 * propagate upward — an application layer that wraps this one and is itself
 * shared as a module constant reintroduces the hazard, so mark such wrappers
 * `Layer.fresh` too.
