/**
 * The Lambda Collector's configuration, as combinators over generated
 * `effect/Schema` codecs rather than hand-authored interfaces.
 *
 * The codecs come from `@distilled.cloud/otel-collector`, which compiles the
 * JSON Schemas reflected out of the collector's own Go config structs into one
 * codec per component, whose TYPE side is camelCase + `Duration.Duration` and
 * whose ENCODED side is the snake_case, Go-duration-string form the
 * collector's loader reads. The `service` block, which is not a component and
 * therefore has no reflected schema, is hand-authored there as a manual spec
 * and compiled the same way — so nothing in this file re-types the collector.
 *
 * Three properties follow from that, and they are why the configuration is
 * written here rather than as a `collector.yaml` on disk:
 *
 * - **Field coverage is not a promise, it is a build artifact.** A field is
 *   missing only if the collector build does not have it.
 * - **Validation is eager and located.** A typo is caught at the declaration
 *   site, in the constructor call that made it, with a JSON path — not at
 *   emission, and not by the extension crash-looping after a green deploy.
 * - **Emission is the encoder.** {@link collector} does not re-walk a config
 *   deciding how to render each leaf; the codec already produced the wire
 *   shape. What is left is only what a codec cannot do: resolving the
 *   references that are not strings yet.
 *
 * ## Everything a section holds is derived from a reference
 *
 * There is one rule, applied twice. You never write a config SECTION and then
 * a list of names into it; you write values, hand the values to whatever uses
 * them, and the section is whatever got used:
 *
 * - a {@link pipeline} holds receiver/processor/exporter VALUES, so
 *   `receivers:`, `processors:` and `exporters:` are derived from the
 *   pipelines;
 * - an exporter's `auth.authenticator` holds an extension VALUE, so
 *   `extensions:` and `service.extensions` are derived from the exporters.
 *
 * Deduplication is by **reference identity** in both cases: one `sigv4Auth`
 * value shared by two exporters is one entry in `extensions:`, exactly as one
 * exporter value shared by two pipelines is one entry in `exporters:`. A
 * component that no one references cannot be declared, and a name that
 * references nothing cannot be written.
 *
 * ## The static/dynamic split
 *
 * A codec can only validate values it can see. Several kinds of leaf are not
 * strings yet at declaration time:
 *
 * - an `Output` (or `Effect`) that resolves at deploy;
 * - a `Redacted`, whose material must never reach the config file, because the
 *   config layer is an ordinary downloadable Lambda layer;
 * - a `Config` primitive — `Config.redacted("AXIOM_TOKEN")` — which does not
 *   carry a value at all, but NAMES one the deployed environment provides;
 * - an {@link interpolate} template, which is the two of those plus literal
 *   text, concatenated;
 * - an {@link Extension} value, whose component id is not decided until
 *   `collector()` sees what name it was declared under.
 *
 * Note what is NOT in that list: a `${env:...}` string. That syntax is this
 * module's output, never its input — a reference is written as the value it
 * refers to, and the emitter decides how it renders.
 *
 * So every generated interface carries a `Str` type parameter over its *plain
 * string* leaves, and the constructors instantiate it at
 * {@link CollectorInput}: `Exporter.otlpHttp` takes
 * `OtlpHttpExporter<CollectorInput>`. Enums, numbers, booleans and durations
 * are `Str`-free and stay closed — an `Output<string>` is not a spelling of
 * `basic | normal | detailed`.
 *
 * At construction each such leaf is swapped for a unique **sentinel string**,
 * so the codec still validates the whole structure (the sentinel satisfies the
 * `string` the schema expects), and the reference is parked. At emission a
 * deferred sentinel becomes `${env:NAME}` — the name GENERATED from the config
 * path when the deploy owns the value, or the name the `Config` already
 * carries when the environment does — while an extension sentinel becomes the
 * component id the extension ended up declared under. Only in the first case
 * is anything handed to the Function's environment.
